  <summary><h2>📘 Some interesting projects</h2></summary>

<h3>Fintechs 💰</h3>
I contributed to a unicorn fintech startup that successfully secured multiple Series-B funding rounds. My role was transversal, focused on developing tools and libraries to enhance the speed and agility of other teams.

During this time, I promoted good practices such as reducing mocks for third-party libraries, applying dependency inversion or adopting repository pattern for cleaner code. I also led the shift from MVC to Clean Architecture and improved testing strategies.

<h3>Ecommerces 🛒</h3>
I have worked on several projects related with e-commerce platforms related with customized meal plans for pets. Using a confidential formula, I developed specific plans for pets taking into account pet's charachteristics and breed, supporting both one-time purchases and recurring payments.

As this project was built up from scracth, it was covered by a robust battery of unit, integration and e2e tests while using clean architechture and also Domain Driven Design.

<h3>Learning platforms 🧑‍🏫</h3>
I have worked for a big corporate engineering firm's learning platform. This project was built from scracth and allows the Human Resource department doing an exhaustive Training Need Analysis and elaborate a plan for improving employees skills. The platform leveraged AI to suggest courses based on their content.

One of the key challenges was implementing dynamic course and resource visibility based on user profiles. Additionally, I developed an integration with Workday to retrieve and map data for over 60.000 employees within the learning system.

<h3>Institutional webs 🏛️</h3>
I have worked on projects to enhance existing institutional webs improving loading times. In this case I made up a proxy backend that implements an ETL process to gather information from different API's, discard, select and persist it for further use.

This process runs continuously, caching fresh data from multiple APIs in a Redis database to ensure quick access and optimal performance.
